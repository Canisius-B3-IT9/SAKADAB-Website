Compost, a mixture of organic materials decayed to use for plant use, balances soil density, which helps in the plant's growth.<br/> 
Compost aids in liquifing too-tight soils, but too loose compost aids in clumping the soil together.<br/>
This balancing enables plants to build stronger roots in the soil, which supports stronger development.<br/>
The value of compost to plants is that it can help the plants to grow faster, healthier, and stronger.<br/></p>


<p class="textbook"><b><span class="problem">Problem and Hypothesis</span></b><br>
Problem:<br>
How will the eggshells affect the development of the Abelmoschus esculentus with compost?<br>
Hypothesis:<br>
If the plant is given eggshells as fertilizer, then the growth rate of the<br>
Abelmoschus Esculentus will be faster, resulting to a bigger and fresher product.<br>


<p class="textbox"><b><span class="problem">Experiment Variables</span></b><br>
Independent Variable: Amount of fertilizer (eggshells)<br/>
Dependent Variable: Growth Rate/Internal Structure/External Appearance of Abelmoschus esculentus (Okra)<br/>
Controlled Variables:<br/>
> Number of seeds/seedlings of Okra<br/>
> Soil Type and Quantity<br/>
> Type and Size of Pot<br/>
> Quantity of Water<br/>
> Sunlight Intensity<br/>
> Surrounding Temperature<br/>
> Location of Experiment<br/>

<img class="SAKADAB" src="SIP 2.jpg" align= "Right">
In making compost, we should have organic materials that will be broken down to smaller particles,<br> 
also known as COMPOSTABLES. We require banana peels, vegetable peelings, dried leaves, eggshells,<br>
and grass cuttings as the compost starting materials.<br>
And for the rest of the experiment, in terms of planting, we need the Okra seeds, soil, pots,<br>
water, and shovels (preferably those suitable for gardening such as round-digger and hand-held shovel).<br></p>
